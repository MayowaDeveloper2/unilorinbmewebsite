                <p>Our programs is hinged on academic training for prospective engineers who will integrate the emerging principle of modern biology with other basic sciences to provide solutions for fundamental and applied problems in biology
                    and medicine, giving broad engineering background in general engineering disciplines in the first two years and in core biomedical engineering courses in the last three years of the programme.

                <p>Biomedical Engineering is an interdisciplinary field that is connected with the use of engineering principles and medicine to biological and medical problems. It involves the applications
                    of concepts, knowledge, and approaches of almost all engineering disciplines to problems.
                </p>
                <p>The biomedical programme is compatible with the mission of insititution on human resources development, research and community service.
                    Graduates of the programme will help fill the human skills gap in engineering, medical establishment, and other areas of human endeavor. In the
                    long run, the biomedical engineering programme will help to improve the health care delivery system in Nigeria and thereby reduce the need for people to travel
                    out of the country for medical attention
